\chapter{Introduction}

\textbf{Goals:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The primary goal of \textit{Matrix Forensics} is to \textbf{solve crimes of matrix math}.
That is, to make the sometimes mystifying manipulations of matrix math more understandable by cataloging useful identities, transformations, and facts.

\item \textbf{To be a community-accessible project.} Anyone can contribute to the project. The source code for the book is available on Github and the source code has been thoughtfully arranged with handy macros to help maintain an easy-to-use, aesthetic, and consistent notation and typography.
\end{enumerate}
