 abstract  = {A method is developed which permits integer-preserving elimination in systems of linear equations, AX = B, such that (a) the magnitudes of the coefficients in the transformed matrices are minimized, and (b) the computational efficiency is considerably increased in comparison with the corresponding ordinary (single-step) Gaussian elimination. The algorithms presented can also be used for the efficient evaluation of determinants and their leading minors. Explicit algorithms and flow charts are given for the two-step method. The method should also prove superior to the widely used fraction-producing Gaussian elimination when A is nearly singular.},

Thiswork builds on recent ideas of Volker Strassen, by using a basic trilinear form which is not a matrix product. We make novel use of the Salem-Spencer Theorem, which gives a fairly dense set of integers with no three-term arithmetic progression. Our resulting matrix exponent is 2.376."
