 abstract  = {A method is developed which permits integer-preserving elimination in systems of linear equations, AX = B, such that (a) the magnitudes of the coefficients in the transformed matrices are minimized, and (b) the computational efficiency is considerably increased in comparison with the corresponding ordinary (single-step) Gaussian elimination. The algorithms presented can also be used for the efficient evaluation of determinants and their leading minors. Explicit algorithms and flow charts are given for the two-step method. The method should also prove superior to the widely used fraction-producing Gaussian elimination when A is nearly singular.},

Thiswork builds on recent ideas of Volker Strassen, by using a basic trilinear form which is not a matrix product.

After several reductions, we show that it is sufficient to analyze periodic systems having, at most, one generalized ⋆-Sylvester equation. We provide characterizations for the nonsingularity in terms of spectral properties of either matrix pencils or formal matrix products, both constructed from the coefficients of the system. The proposed approach uses the periodic Schur decomposition and leads to a backward stable O(n3r) algorithm for computing the (unique) solution.},
