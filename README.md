Matrix Forensics
================

Matrix Forensics is an extensive, yet to-the-point reference manual for matrix math. It is designed to be a quick reference for:

* Identifying valid transformations
* Reminding yourself of, e.g., matrix calculus identities
* Finding appropriate computational shortcuts, such as perturbations
* And more!

The guide is freely available as a PDF [here](matrix_forensics.pdf).
